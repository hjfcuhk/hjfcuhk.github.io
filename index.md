## Biography

I am an associate professor of the Department of Decision Sciences and Managerial Economics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. 
My research interests are in asymptotic analysis and optimal control of queuing systems and their applications in services such as healthcare systems (e.g. emergency departments) and tele-services (e.g. telephone call centres). 
My work has been published in journals such as _Operations Research_ and _Mathematics of Operations Research_. 
My research awards include the _Uriel G. Rothblum Prize for Excellent Work in Operations Research_ by the Operations Research Society of Israel and the _MSOM Service Management SIG Best Paper Award_.
